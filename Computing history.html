    <p>Thousands of years ago, calculations were completed through the use of fingers
        and materials that were just lying around. Technology has revolutionized so much that even the most complicated
        computations are done within seconds.Everyday, the dependency of computers is continuously growing. Just imagine
        how hard life would be without computers.Without the findings or advancements of computers and devices, life
        itself today would be troublesome.We ought to give credit to those intelligent individuals of the past for their
        contributions in today’s life.

    <p>Back then, calculation was an everyday necessity for many individuals and kept
        everything organized. The operation of addition and subtraction was done through counting stones or pebbles.
        One of the early versions of counting tables, named the abaci, was used for many calculations and this concept
        is similar to the notations that we use today. Furthermore, this led to the first very first, formal calculator,
        the Abacus. The Chinese Abacus was developed 5000 years ago and was made entirely of wood and beads. The Abacus
        itself does not do the same computing compared to today’s calculators, but back in that era, it helped people
        keep track of numbers as they do computing. It was not until thousands of years later that the first calculator
        was produced. In 1623, the first calculator was created by Wilhelm Schickard which was also referred to as
        “Calculating Clock.” The device was used to perform the basic operations of arithmetic. Still, there had not
        been yet been anything that be considered as computer. But finally, in 1625, the slide rule was invented
        becoming the very first “analog computer” of the modern ages. In 1642, one of the biggest breakthroughs came f
        rom Blaise Pascal, who invented a mechanical calculator and its main functions were adding and subtracting
        numbers. Subsequently, a man named Gottfried Leibniez greatly improved Pascal’s model by allowing it to perform
        other operations such as multiplication, division, and square root.

    <p>As technology continues to prosper in the nineteenth century, the creation of new devices and ideas is inevitable.
        A major figure during this time is Charles Babbage, who designed the idea of the difference engine.
        It was a calculating machine constructed to tabulate the results of mathematical equations and functions.
        Charles, however, never completed the machine because he thought of a new creation which was the Analytical Engine.
        This machine was expected to solve any “mathematical problem” and this device relied on the punch card input.
        This machine was never finished by Babbage.

    <p>The twentieth century was filled with many important inventions that are still
        widely used in today’s society.An invention, created by four men at Bell Labs in 1947, the transistor became one of the most essential
        inventions of the times.Today, silicon is used to build transistors which are used in integrated circuits.
        In 1964, the System 360 was released by IBM.It set the precedent for future computers.
        By the 70’s personal computers were being brought into the society. This same decade led to the creation of the
        computer language BASIC and the formation of the Microsoft by Bill Gates and Paul Allen.Windows was first
        established in 1985 and today, it is believed to be running in over ten million computers worldwide.

    <p>Without the works of others in the past, life today itself would be very different.
        Of course this only a brief overview of the computing and computer history, there are many other important
        figures/ideas that I did not cover.
        But in the end, without all their contributions, technology would not have gone as far as it is today.
